# TGFb-Network-Boolean-Dynamic-Modelling

The models developed and the programs written are adapted for a six-node network based on TGF-beta signaling in cancer cells. A figure describing this network cited from the article titled, '[Boolean dynamic modeling of cancer signaling networks: Prognosis, progression, and therapeutics](https://www.che.iitb.ac.in/web/faculty/ganesh/pdfs/2021/booleanModelingCancerSignalingNetworks.pdf),' authored by Sherekar S. and Viswanathan G., published in Computational and Systems Oncology in 2021, is shown below.
